Highlights of Audit Engagements

## Audit of Mobile Devices 
The Audit of Mobile Devices was an information system management audit of MTA’s mobile devices, which included cellphones and laptops. To plan and conduct this audit I developed a risk-based IT audit strategy in compliance with IT audit standard COBIT 5 Mobile Device Management. The IT resource investments and prioritization of mobile devices was evaluated to determine alignment with IT governance structure. I flowcharted and assessed the systems functional controls to determine whether Metro ITS investment (in such system) supported the business objectives and that appropriate internal controls were embedded in the mobile device system to monitor and tracking the company’s mobile devices. I evaluated Third party management practices to determine that expected levels of controls are being adhered to by service providers, such as T-Mobile, AT&T. Audit recommendations were made to enhance the processes and procedures used to store and dispose sensitive information stored on mobile devices.
